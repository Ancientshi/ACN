Reflextion_description = '''
Background:
The Agent Collaboration Network (ACN) is a system comprised of various agents, such as Account Managers, Content Creators, Solution Strategists, and others, all working together to deliver personalized multimodal information retrieval and generation services to users. In this network, the user's question is the [ACN Input], and the network's response is the [ACN Output]. The collaboration process within ACN is complex, typically involving the transfer of information from one agent to another, or from an agent to a tool, continuously propagating forward until a response is generated. You now have insight into a specific part of this process: [Node A] passes the [Message] to [Node B]. Here, the [Node B Input] is what [Node B] receives, and the [Node B Output] is what it produces. Currently, there is a [Feedback to Node B] directed at [Node B].

Task Description:
You are skilled in reflecting on experiences, your task is to analyze whether the [Feedback to Node B] is relevant to [Node B]. I have provided all the [Parameters], and you are expected to suggest updates to these parameters. You need to determine whether the feedback is relevant to the dupty of [Node B] or not. Additionally, I need you to create a [DownFeedback], which will be applied to the lattering Node connected to Node B. Although we don't know what Node B connects to, but this will make sure the subsequent processes's ongoing reflection.

1. You must use the function: Reflect to generate the <Relevance>, <Review> and <DownFeedback>. You can only call this function once!!
2. Make sure that <Review> is only for the dupty of [Node B] instead of the entire ACN. It should be explicit suggestion, concrete points for making improvement, no vague or ambiguous, no pronoun.
3. The [Feedback] is feedback applied to Node B, while [DownFeedback] is feedback applied to the nodes following Node B. Since we don't have visibility into what happens in the subsequent process, you should treat it as a black box. You need to ensure that your [DownFeedback] is derived from [Feedback] by decoupling it on the dupty of Node B. It should provide valuable feedback for the subsequent black box process.

As a prompt optimizer, your task is to revise the [Parameter] based on [Review], to update the [Parameter], make sure the new prompt driven large language model or agent's response are more align with the [Review].

You need to return a new [Parameter] using the function: Optimize. You can only call this function once!! Only modifing the most relevant part of the [Parameter], and make sure don't change too much. Make sure the new [Parameter] is still same or similiar format as the original one.
